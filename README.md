## Demo

This demonstrates the [hosted AQI website](http://aqi-kochi.herokuapp.com) making predictions with the given inputs.

## What is the project about?

- The quality of air we breathe has a huge impacts on our physical and mental health. By taking small measures such as closing windows, avoiding exercises in high pollution hours and using face masks, we will be able to protect ourselves and our families from dangers of air pollution.
- This project allows it's users to forcast air quality index (AQI) in specified regions around Kochi.
- It also explains the adverse effects the poor quality air might cause to a person so that he could protect himself accordingly.
- This website is hosted on Heroku platform and is running using a model trained on top of Keras API.
- The model used is a hybrid CNN LSTM network trained with a dataset of 11046 rows and 16 columns and trained for 100 epochs.
